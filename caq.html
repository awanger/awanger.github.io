                    This project is based on a paper by Shelley Carson, PhD and Jordan Peterson, PhD.  During their research, they came up with a self-report questionnaire 
                    that attempts to quantify an individual’s creative achievement. The questionnaire covers achievement across 10 domains of creativity (e.g. visual arts, music, dance, etc.) For the original paper, please click here

                <div class="project-text">While filling out the survey, I found it to be cumbersome. It required jumping around between sections, manually calculating your score, and overall was a tedious experience. I started questioning whether it was worth the trouble to get my CAQ score. The research was certainly thorough, but the experience of filling out the questionnaire 
                    felt drawn-out. I wanted to make the experience and accessible.

                    Carson’s research explores achievement in 10 domains of creativity. The original questionnaire 
                    is divided into 10 sections accordingly. In the beginning of each section, the user is first 
                    if they have any training or recognize talent. If they do, they are instructed to fill out the rest of 
                    that section. If not, they are instructed to go to the next area. Majority (if not at all) users won’t fill out every section. 
                    The below diagram illustrates the inefficiency of the original form.

                    To reduce the amount of time the user spent filling out the form. 
                    Instead of having the user go through all 10 domains, the user is 
                    asked upfront which of the domains they have 
                    training or recognized training. Please see diagram below.
