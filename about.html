          💻 My name is Alex and this is my about page 😏 I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and am
          currently studying for my Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. I have always been fascinated by the
          interaction between people and technology, hence my career choice. The interaction designer who has had the most influence on me is
          Larry Tesler (the guy who came up with the idea of copy paste). My favorite quote by him: "You should
          judge success by the success of the product and the team, not just by the success of your own narrow contribution."

          🎹 I'm an avid pianist and my favorite composers are Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff. 
          Currently, I'm practicing some pieces by Philip Glass and Federico Mompou. I'm also learning Schenkerian analysis,
          which is a reductionist method of analyzing tonal music. Here's my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alex-wang-84">SoundCloud.</a>

          🪄 While I was at Medidata, I performed a lot of magic tricks around the office. People gave me funny names like "Magic Man" and 
          "Asian Harry Potter." Here's my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexwangmagic/">Instagram.</a>
