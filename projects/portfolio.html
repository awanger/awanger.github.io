        <p>
          Strictly speaking this isn’t a design case study, but I still wanted to 
          share my process of developing this website. Inspired by Adam Riddle’s 
          portfolio, I sought to essentially translate his design into code, while adding in my 
          personal touches. I decided against using a CSS framework 
          (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.) and opted to write everything from scratch. 
          The reason is that CSS frameworks are like black boxes that hide technical details, which 
          would hinder my goal to understand what is happening under the hood.

        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Weaknesses of Site Builders</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Costs.</b> Site builders can be costly in the long term. Squarespace, for example, costs $12 a month which is more than $100 a year just to host static pages. 
          This does not seem like a good deal to me, a frugal grad school student. 
          On the other hand, to host a page on GitHub is completely free, albeit more work. 
          It would require knowledge of Git and HTML, CSS, and JS. For me the effort to learn these technologies was 
          well-worth saving the 100 dollars per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Flexibility.</b> You might ask, “What about free site builders like Wordpress? Wouldn’t you save both money and effort with a service like this?” 
          The reason I chose to host on GitHub over these free options is that they lack flexibility. You are limited to uninspiring, cookie-cutter templates. 
          Just look at Adobe Portfolio. What if I wanted to move my logo slightly inward? It’s not so apparent where to make the adjustment.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          But since I coded my portfolio, I know exactly which line of CSS controls the 
          width of the site container. Site builders simply can’t compete in terms of flexibility. 
          This is why I prefer to code my website, to have full control of where elements are positioned.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Interest in Coding</h2>
        <p>
          I used a few different technologies to help create the site: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Jekyll - to keep all the HTML files organized and to make the code as DRY as possible</li>
          <li>Sass - essentially an enhanced version of CSS. The main advantage over CSS is the ability to split up the code into different files to keep things organized.</li>
          <li>Vanilla JavaScript - to create dynamic elements like the color changing navbar</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="project-body">
        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Responsive Layout</h2>
        <p>
          Nowadays, responsive layouts are standard and relatively simple to implement with 
          CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. Instead of relying on these tools, I challenged myself 
          to create a responsive layout from CSS, to understand how these tools work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise wasn’t just to sharpen my coding skills; it also serves a very practical purpose. 
          The readers of my portfolio are likely busy with other responsibilities and would skim through 
          portfolios during their spare time. Given this scenario, it would make sense to create a mobile 
          version so they can eat their sandwich with one hand and hold their phone in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hover Effects.</b>
          One issue that I overlooked initially was the mouse hover issue. On the desktop version, the user 
          would hover over a tile and the title of the project would appear.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="/assets/img/three_rows.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
          I initially overlooked the fact that on mobile platforms there are no hover 
          interactions. To work around this limitation, I made the project titles
          permanently visible.

      <div class="project-header">Empathy Within The Team</div>
      <div class="project-body">
      <p>
        As designers, we are taught to empathize with our users. Without empathy, we would just be blindly designing UI that might gain traction 
        on Dribbble but do not solve any meaningful problems. The key to a successful product is empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I feel that this empathy should not be limited to users. We have to empathize with many different teams and one of them is 
        the development team. It is crucial to be able to communicate with the engineers and to empathize with them. Afterall, without 
        them the product will never be built. This experience has allowed me to walk in their shoes and to understand the challenges they face with development. I’ve gained a deeper appreciation of the work they 
        do and am more mindful of the technical limitations of a design.
