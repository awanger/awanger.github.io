        <p>
          This is my design research project, sponsored by the <a href="https://drexel.edu/excite/discovery/met-lab/" class="highlight" target="_blank">Music and Entertainment Technology Laboratory (MET-lab)</a> at Drexel University.
          I worked alongside my professor, Youngmoo Kim, who is a pioneer in music technology research. I was responsible for conducting user research, prototyping, and usability testing. 
          In other words, end-to-end experience design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music notation software is not exactly known for being intuitive. 
          Most music notation software follows a design paradigm where the user clicks on note duration and then clicks on the staff to plot the note, which can be difficult to do precisely.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">The Problem</div>
        <p>
          Within musical circles, it is just accepted that music notation software is subpar.  
          <strong>The music community needs notation software that is intuitive and empowers them to be creative without any usability obstacles.</strong> 
          The problem space for music notation software is enormous, so the goal of this research project would be to narrow down on a specific usability problem.

          To learn more about specific usability problems, I used a combination of <strong>interviews</strong> and <strong>usability tests</strong>. 
          The goal of the interviews is to understand the world that the user lives in, while the goal of usability tests is to narrow in on specific usability problems.</p>
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Interviews</div>
        <p>
          I first conducted a pilot interview with my professor to work out any possible kinks in the flow. Once we felt confident in the protocol, I took a trip to <strong> Yale University </strong> where I interviewed <strong>three music students </strong></b>.
        </p>
        <p>My protocol included questions like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What role does technology play in your musical studies?</li>
          <li>When was the last time you used [music notation program]? Could you tell me about your experience?</li>
          <li>Could you tell me about any particularly frustrating times when you used [music notation program]?</li>
          <li>Is there a specific type of music notation that you had difficulty notating in [music notation program]?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          From my interviews, there was no shortage of insights. Here is a summary:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>One user tried using Sibelius, but gave up out of frustration after a short while and resorted to pencil and paper.</li>
          <li>When writing more complex music, the music notation program would be overly pedantic when the user wants more freedom in how they write.</li>
          <li>Users were overwhelmed by the number of keyboard shortcuts that are available in music notation software. They feel that with practice, they could become proficient, but the learning curve is quite steep.</li>
        </ol>

        "They [the music notation app] did have a long, a huge index of [keyboard] shortcuts, but it's way too cumbersome to look for something and then scroll in the index to try to find the shortcut when I could have just clicked on it."

        <p>
          In addition to the interviews, I also conducted moderated usability tests on MuseScore, a popular, open-source music notation app.
          For the usability test, I asked a total of two users (so far) to notate various musical excerpts to understand how they interact with the software.
