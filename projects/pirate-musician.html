          This is my design research project, sponsored by the <a href="https://drexel.edu/excite/" class="highlight" target="_blank">the ExCITe Center</a>, Drexel University's in-house design innovation lab.
          I worked alongside the director, Youngmoo Kim, who is a pioneer in music technology research. I was responsible for conducting user research, prototyping, and usability testing.

        <p>
          Music notation software is not exactly known for being intuitive. 
          Most music notation software follows a point-and-click paradigm, where the user clicks on note duration and then clicks on the staff to plot the note, which can be difficult to do precisely.

        <div class="paragraph-header">The Problem</div>
        <p>
          Within musical circles, it is just accepted that music notation software is subpar.  
          <strong>The music community needs notation software that is intuitive and empowers them to be creative without any usability obstacles.</strong> 
          The problem space for music notation software is enormous, so the goal of this research project would be to narrow down on a specific usability problem.

          To better understand the problem space, I used a conducted <strong>interviews</strong>, <strong>heuristic analysis</strong>, <strong>usability tests</strong>.

          <li>What role does technology play in your musical studies?</li>
          <li>When was the last time you used [music notation program]? Could you tell me about your experience?</li>
          <li>Could you tell me about any particularly frustrating times when you used [music notation program]?</li>
          <li>Is there a specific type of music notation that you had difficulty notating in [music notation program]?</li>

        <ol>
          <li>One user tried using Sibelius, but gave up out of frustration after a short while and resorted to pencil and paper.</li>
          <li>When writing more complex music, the music notation program would be overly pedantic when the user wants more freedom in how they write.</li>
          <li>Users were overwhelmed by the number of keyboard shortcuts that are available in music notation software. They feel that with practice, they could become proficient, but the learning curve is quite steep.</li>

      <div class="project-body">
        <p>
          Together with my advisor Youngmoo Kim, we conducted heuristic analysis based on <strong>Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics</strong>. Heuristic analyses
          are useful for finding usability problems in a user interface without the need for users. We can also be much more thorough with the analysis than with a usability test, as there
          are no time limits or other restrictions. That being said, I did conduct usability testing later to find any usability problems that I might've missed during the heuristic analysis.

        <div class="paragraph-header">Mode Errors - Violation of Nielsen's First Heuristic</div>
        <p>
          While conducting the heuristic analysis, the most egregious violation I discovered was with Nielsen's first heuristic: <strong>Visibility of System Status</strong>.

        <p>
          While there is much to learn from conducting user interviews and heuristic analysis, these two methods
          don't show how users actually interact with the software. As Jakob Nielsen stated, "pay attention to what users do, not what they say."
          This is why I conducted usability tests.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Usability Test Protocol</div>
        <p>
          For the usability test, I had users notate musical excerpts into MuseScore, a free music notation editor
          that is fairly representative of all music notation software. I explicitly stated that I was testing the app and not
          their abilities. Here are some of the tasks I had the users complete:
