        This project was inspired by a research paper by Shelley Carson, Ph.D advised by Jordan Peterson. During their
        research, they came up with a self-report questionnaire
        that attempts to quantify an individual’s creative achievement. The questionnaire covers achievement across
        ten domains of creativity (e.g. visual arts, music, dance, etc.)

      <div class="project-text-header">Pain Points</div>
       <p class="project-text">While filling out the survey, I found it to be cumbersome. It required jumping around
        between sections, manually calculating your score, and overall was a tedious experience. I started questioning
        whether it was worth the trouble to get my CAQ score. The research was certainly thorough, but the experience
        of filling out the questionnaire
        felt drawn-out. I wanted to make the experience and accessible.

        Carson’s research explores achievement in ten creative domains. The original questionnaire
        is divided into ten sections accordingly. At the beginning of each section, the user is first
        asked if they have any training or recognize talent for that domain. If so, they are instructed to fill out
        the rest of
        that section. If not, they are instructed to go to the next domain. Majority (if not at all) users won’t need
        to fill out every section.
        The below diagram illustrates the inefficiency of the original form.

        To reduce the amount of time the user spent filling out the form.
        Instead of having the user go through all ten domains, the user is
        asked upfront which of the domains they have
        experience in. They are only asked questions pertaining to the domains they selected; essentially the
        irrelevant sections are hidden from them.

       <p class="project-text">
        For the visual design, I used Adobe XD and went for a bubbly feel, using bright colors and round text.
        I wanted to turn the pencil and paper experience into something more fun and interactive.

       <p class="project-text">
        The paper-and-pencil questionnaire felt like another long form to fill out, like filing your taxes. The
        original form basically commands the user to fill in certain criteria. To make it less dreadful, I rephrased
        all of the original statements into questions.
        <br><br>

        For example instead of:
        <blockquote>“Place a check mark beside sentences that apply to you”</blockquote>

        We replace it with the question:
        <blockquote>“Which of these statements apply to you?”</blockquote>

        This way feels more like a conversation between the user and the system.

       <p class="project-text">
        The initial prototype had a little helper character that I ended up scrapping because it took too much screen
        space.
        I also had to redo the whole interface as it was lacking visual hierarchy.
