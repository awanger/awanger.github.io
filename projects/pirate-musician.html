          This is a music education app that I am designing for my capstone project. I started it about a year ago before I entered
          grad school and has now become my capstone project.
          There are many music education apps out in the market, but the user experience is sub-par. The music technology space is plagued with poorly designed apps.
          In the words of my professor, "music software just sucks."
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on improving the dictation exercise experience. For context, dictation is an exercise where the student listens to a short musical excerpt and then transcribes it into written form.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Background</div>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, dictation is an exercise where the student listens to some music and writes it down. One
          commonly used practice tool is Teoria. Upon opening the app, the user is flooded with different settings. Even for a music student
          like myself, the number of options are overwhelming.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Problem Statement</div>
        <p>
          Music students need a tool that will allow them to efficiently practice dictation so they can get over the dread of their music theory courses.

          Though I was a music student myself, I avoided personal bias by conducting user research to ground my design choices. 
          I first created a persona based on my experiences in undergrad. With the persona in hand, I proceeded to interview actual music students to confirm the accuracy of the persona.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Interviews</div>
        <p>
          Though I had lived among music students, I wanted more insights, so I interviewed more students from schools like Northwestern, Yale, and Juilliard. The main purpose of the interviews was to learn about their pain points during music school. Some of the questions I asked included:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How do you practice for your ear training courses(s)?</li>
          <li>What are your frustrations with the ear training apps that are available?</li>
          <li>Out of all the apps that you've mentioned, what frustrates you about them?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In total, I interviewed three music students. Some of the answers were unexpected. For instance, many students expressed that they dislike ear training. They see it as something to “just get over with” and would much rather practice their instruments. I also discovered that the students’ professors would assign exercises on Teoria (I feel sorry for these students).
        </p>

          I proceeded to sketch some designs based on the insights that I gained from the interviews. As mentioned earlier, one of the students did not even use any app. She would play recordings on her laptop and then write down the answers. 
          My app design reflects her learning process.
         </p>
        <p>
          While interviewing users, many complained about the ugly UI in current music apps. They would say things like “The apps look so dated.”
          “Ear training is already joyless, why make it worse with an ugly app?”

         I started out with pencil and paper sketches but quickly realized there was no way to test them on actual users, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
         So I immediately transferred the paper sketch onto Adobe XD and subsequently Protopie, which was used to add interactions.
        </p>

         As mentioned earlier, this project was done during quarantine so all the usability test sessions were conducted over Zoom. In total, I tested three participants, each one received the same set of tasks.
       </p>
       <div class="paragraph-header">List of Usability Tasks</div>
       <ol>
         <li>Could you show me how you would play the exercise?</li>
         <li>Now imagine the question is too difficult. Without looking at the answer, where would you go to adjust the exercise and make it easier?</li>
         <li>How would you go about closing the settings section?</li>
         <li>Could you try completing the exercise now?</li>
         <li>How would you view the answer?</li>
         <li>Suppose you wanted to see the answer for all four parts, how would you go about doing that?</li>
       </ol>

        <p>I've gained a lot of insight from the usability test. Some of these include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When first presented with the screen, many participants were confused on what to do. I had to explain the design.</li>
          <li>The exercise was too difficult for even some Juilliard students. I added a feature which allowed them to adjust the number of voices that could be played at the same time.</li>
          <li>
            It took all participants many playbacks to get the answer. In the original design, there was a set number of attempts allowed, this number could be adjusted in the settings menu. 
            One user, when he ran out of attempts, would go to the settings menu to give himself more attempts. He did this three times. To simplify things, I removed the set number of attempts.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I took all the insights and am modifying the prototype accordingly. 
          I decided to implement the prototype with JavaScript as Adobe XD and Figma have limited capabilities.
          At the time of writing this, construction has already started. Please click here for the GitHub code.

        <p>
          After conducting the usability test, the participants were overall happy with the design. One of my participants even mentioned
          getting me into contact with the music theory professor at the Yale School of Music. Communication is ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I learned about the importance of conducting user testing. 
          Otherwise, how would I know if my design is actually solving the problem the user is dealing with?
          My next steps would be to develop and the test the JavaScript version to gain further insights. Depending on
          availability, I will attempt to find different users to test on.
