          My Role
        </div>
        <p>
          This was my submission to Drexel University’s online design competition. I was involved in the design process and took 
          responsibility for creating the mid- and high-fidelity prototypes. I implemented the <a href="https://rocky-everglades-93850.herokuapp.com/" class="highlight" target="_blank">mid-fidelity prototype</a> using a JavaScript 
          framework called Vue.JS and designed the <a href="https://bit.ly/2MuYNCJ" class="highlight" target="_blank">high-fidelity prototype</a> in Figma due to time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this was a challenging experience, figuring out how to work with classmates whom I have yet to meet in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to
          overcome this hurdle with good communication. We were intentional about being critical yet open-minded to different design ideas.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Problem Statement</div>
        <p> 
          Students need a flexible way to create a master’s program that fits their academic and professional goals.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Design Objectives</div>
        <ol>
          <li>To create a web app design allows users to “mix and match” certificate programs to form a full master’s degree</li>
          <li>All certificate options should be viewable/selectable by the user</li>
          <li>For any combination of three certificates selected, users will see the master’s degree(s) they can obtain</li>

      <div class="project-body">
        <p>
          We created a short profile of the target user based on the contest's introductory session.
          The target audience was prospective graduate school students. This group would include working professionals who are already taking certificates 
          and the age could vary significantly from 22 years old to even 60 years old. We took this into consideration as not every user is technically savvy.

         <div class="paragraph-header">Brainstorming</div>
         <p>
          After conducting research, we proceeded with ideation. In his book "Applied Imagination", Alex Osborn states that a mix of individual and group brainstorming sessions is the most effective method of generating ideas. 
          We followed his suggestion by first brainstorming individually and only then meeting up for a group session.

          Using Miro, we created a sticky note mosaic of all of our ideas. We then split off again to sketch possible design solutions. 
          When we reconvened, we voted on the most promising design. The criterion for “most promising” was based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
          From that point, after a few modifications, that design became our low-fidelity prototype that would be used for testing.

        <div class="paragraph-header">First Round</div>
        <p>
          Despite the tight timeline, we aimed to fit in at least two rounds of user testing. For the first round, we used the low fidelity prototype (created by my teammate) shown in the figure below. 
          In our “Wizard of Oz” testing, we had one team member act as the “wizard” (controller) and the other team member as the observer. The wizard would show the user a screen and ask them to perform a task. 
          When the user clicked on an element, the wizard would manually navigate to the next appropriate screen.
        </p>

          The user would select a certificate that they are interested in and it would then appear in the footer.
          Once the user selects on three certificates, they can click on the submit button and get their results.
        </p>
        <p>
          We received a lot of feedback in our first round and refined our prototype accordingly. 
          One subtle issue we noticed was that users would struggle to click the small checkboxes. 
          To address this issue, we made all the checkboxes into clickable cards. These cards are a much larger target than the small checkboxes which creates a more seamless user experience (based on Fitt’s Law).
          Incidentally, this solution also addresses one of the user’s complaints that the “layout is kinda messy.” All the cards are of uniform shape and size, so it’s easy to place them in a grid layout.

        <div class="paragraph-header">Second Round</div>
        <p>
          For the second version of our design, I created a prototype with JavaScript that I attempted to deploy for our usability tests. This acted as a proof of concept for our mid-fidelity prototype.
          My teammate then created a clickable prototype in Figma which made for a more realistic experience than our low-fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then conducted a second round of usability tests where the user easily completed all the tasks that we gave them. However, we noticed one problem: the design was not mobile-friendly. 
          We got rid of the hover effect and made all possible actions visible on the card (e.g. adding a certificate, learning more about a certificate, etc.).

        <p>
         In the final design, we made significant color palette changes to reflect Drexel’s color palette. 
         In addition to the aesthetic changes, we made our final design mobile-friendly by displaying all the clickable elements on the card. For example, we included a plus sign icon without the need to hover.
         </p>
         <div class="paragraph-header">Judging Criteria</div>
         <p>
            Our design was judged based on three criteria:
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li>Originality and creativity</li>
          <li>Intuitiveness of Design and UX</li>
          <li>Thoroughness of user testing/feedback</li>
         </ol>
         <p>We focused our efforts on solving the problem statement and we evaluated our own design based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability heuristics to ensure that it meets some usability standard.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-header">Takeaways</div>
        <p>
          During this project, I learned how to conduct the usability tests remotely. The majority of these were done over Zoom with family and friends who roughly fit the user profile. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there were unexpected advantages to using Zoom over in-person. For instance, it was very easy to record a session that could be referenced later. There was also no need to set up the logistics of where to meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          While creating the prototypes, we noticed the limitations of conducting usability testing with a Figma document. The test is constrained to a fixed path that we the designers
          have laid out. In this context, the test had the user click certificates in a fixed order. Next time, I would implement a fully functional prototype in code that will give an even more
          realistic experience.
