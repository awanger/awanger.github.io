          My Role
        </div>
        <p>
          This was my submission to Drexel University’s online design competition. I was involved in the design process and took 
          responsibility for creating the mid- and high-fidelity prototypes. I implemented the mid-fidelity prototype using a JavaScript 
          framework called Vue.JS and I designed the high-fidelity prototype in Figma due to time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a challenging experience, figuring out how to work with classmates whom I have yet to meet in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
          Fortunately, the problem statement and the design requirements were laid out clearly by the school.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Problem Statement</div>
        <p> 
          Students need a flexible way to create a master’s program that fits their academic and professional goals. 
          The web app will help students envision the different combination of certificates that they can take to form a full master’s degree at Drexel's College of Computing and Informatics (CCI).
        </p>
        <h2 class="paragraph-header">Design Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>To create an intuitive web-based system design that allows users to “mix and match” certificate programs to arrive at master’s degrees</li>
          <li>All certificate options should be viewable/selectable by the user</li>
          <li>For any combination of three certificates selected, users will see the master’s degree(s) they can obtain</li>
          <!-- <li>Before completing a technical certificate, folks without a background in CS have to complete a CS Foundations Certificate. </li>
          <li>For each degree, a base certificate has to be completed. For example, an HCI/UX degree requires getting an HCI/UX certificate. 
            You can’t put together a Computer Science, a Data Science, and a Software Development certificate together and get an HCI/UX degree out of it.

        <p>
          We created a short profile of the target user based on the contest's introductory session.
          The target audience was prospective graduate school students. This group would include working professionals who are already taking certificates 
          and the age could vary significantly from 22 years old to even 60 years old. We took this into consideration as not every user is technically savvy.

         <div class="paragraph-header">Brainstorming</div>
         <p>
          After conducting research, we proceeded with ideation. In his book <i>Applied Imagination</i>, Alex Osborn states that a mix of individual and group brainstorming sessions is the most effective method of generating ideas. 
          We followed his suggestion by first brainstorming individually and only then meeting up for a group session.

          Using Miro, we created a sticky note mosaic of all of our ideas. We then split off again to sketch possible design solutions. 
          When we met up again, we voted on the most promising design. The criterion for “most promising” was based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
          From that point, after a few modifications, that design became our low-fidelity prototype that would be used for testing.

      <div class="project-body">
        <p>
          Despite the tight timeline, we aimed to fit in at least two rounds of user testing. For the first round, we used the low fidelity prototype (created by my teammate) shown in the figure below. 
          In our “Wizard of Oz” testing, we had one team member act as the “wizard” (controller) and the other team member as the observer. The wizard would show the user a screen and ask them to perform a task. 
          When the user clicked on an element, the wizard would manually navigate to the next appropriate screen.

          The user would check off on a certificate that they are interested in and it would then appear in the footer.
          Once the user checks off on three certificates, they can click on the submit button and get their results.

       <p class="project-body">
        We received a lot of feedback in our first round and refined our prototype accordingly. 
        One subtle issue we noticed was that users would struggle to click the small checkboxes. 
        To address this issue, we made all the checkboxes into clickable cards. These cards are a much larger target than the small checkboxes which creates a more seamless user experience (Fitt’s Law).
        Incidentally, this solution also addresses one of the user’s complaints that the “layout is kinda messy.” All the cards are of uniform shape and size, so it’s easy to place them in a grid layout.

          For the second version of our design, I created a prototype with JavaScript that I attempted to deploy for our usability tests. This acted as a proof of concept for our mid-fidelity prototype.
          My teammate then created a clickable prototype in Figma which made for a more realistic experience than our low-fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then conducted a second round of usability tests where the user easily completed all the tasks that we gave them. However, we noticed one problem: the design was not mobile-friendly. 
          Up to this point in the process, we conducted the usability tests on the desktop. 
          If we opened the prototype on a smartphone, the layout would be messed up. We then proceeded to create the final prototype.

       <p class="project-body">
        In the final design, we made significant color palette changes to reflect Drexel’s color palette. 
        In addition to the aesthetic changes, we made our final design mobile-friendly by displaying all the clickable elements on the card. For example, we included a plus sign icon without the need to hover.

        <p>
          I learned many lessons during this project. The contest had many design submissions and by the end, I was not clear on what made one design “better” than another. Part of the reason is that no clear KPIs were established in the beginning. Do we measure success by tracking the number of downloads? 
          The number of clicks it takes a user to complete a task? What constitutes “intuitive design” exactly?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge—and one of the most difficult—was conducting the usability tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. With limited in-person contact, the majority of the tests were done over Zoom with family and friends who roughly fit the user profile. 
          We were also restricted to digital prototypes—no option for pencil and paper prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there were unexpected advantages to using Zoom over in-person. For instance, it was very easy to record a session that could be referenced later. There was also no need to set up the logistics of where to meet.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-header">Limitations of Clickable Prototype</div>
        <p>
          I found one weakness with all of the prototypes that we tested. We essentially forced all the users to follow a contrived path that we set up for them. This doesn’t accurately reflect how they would use the app in real-life. 
          Creating a fully interactive prototype where there exists multiple paths in the user flow would better simulate real-life conditions.
